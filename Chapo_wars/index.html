               Drug kingpin Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán was captured by the Mexican Navy on January 19, 2016, after escaping prison twice -once hidden in a laundry basket, the second through a tunnel in his cell-. On the day of his third and final capture, armed men belonging to the Sinaloa Cartel, the one he commanded, took to the streets of several states to assert their power over the territory. Two years into his capture, while he sits in a prison cell in New York City, turf wars between the Sinaloa Cartel and rival cartels have led to a historical increase in violence in the country.

                Mexico has a very wide territory, with 32 states and over 120 million population. Therefore, violence is not the same everywhere. One of the most affected is the small state of Colima, located on the west coast of Mexico, and once one of the safest states in the country. There, the extremely violent cartels of Jalisco Nueva Generación (Jalisco New Generation) and Caballeros Templarios (Knight Templars) have been fighting the Sinaloa Cartel over the control of the Port of Manzanillo, where illegal products come and go through the sea. Although the turf war began before El Chapo was finally recaptured, the violence got worse after 2016.

               Another territory with extreme violence levels is northern state of Baja California Sur, known for its beautiful beaches and touristic destinations. After El Chapo was captured, the Sinaloa cartel became fractured and the cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación began fighting it over the control of drug trafficking to the United States and the sale of drug to tourists that visit the beaches.

    The Jalisco Nueva Generación cartel has become more powerful in the last two years and increased its power over several states and even over some U.S territories, where they are also involved in kidnap, extortion, robbery and other crimes. Its leader, Rubén Oseguera "El Mencho", is considered a drug kingpin and has a $1 million reward on its head by Mexican authorities. This week, the Mexican government announced an alliance with the Chicago government to capture him.

        The Mexican government tends to downplay the murder statistics that document the extreme violence in the country. After the 2017 figures came out, Alfonso Navarrete, State Secretary, pointed fingers at the U.S for failing to stop gun trafficking into Mexico. "The main supply of violence in our country are the illegal weapons that enter our country and the money that give corruptive and execution power to the criminal organizations," he claimed. <br><br> An analysis made to statistics of the Department of Justice Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives of the U.S show that an important amount of U.S weapons are found each year in Mexico.

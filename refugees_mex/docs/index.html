How have the asylum requests changed during this political administration?</p> </div> <div class="col-lg-8 sticky"> <div id="chart-1"></div> </div> <div class="col-lg-4"> <div class="step" id="blank-graph"> <p>Six Latin American countries dominate the amount of asylum requests in Mexico. Haiti, the poorest country in the continent, has faced increasing turmoil following the 2010 earthquake that devastated it. Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras form the "Northern Triangle", an area dominated by criminal organizations involved in drug and human trafficking.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="first-graph"> <h2>2013</h2> <p>The political and economical crisis in Venezuela began, but only one person officialy applied for asylum. Hondurans running from gang-related violence were the main solicitors for protection.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="second-graph"> <h2>2014</h2> <p>Requests from people of Honduras and El Salvador double. The trend will continue the next years. </p></div> <div class="step" id="third-graph"> <h2>2015</h2> <p>New presidents are elected in the "Northern Triangle", and gang violence continues to drive people away from their countries. </p></div> <div class="step" id="fourth-graph"> <h2>2016</h2> <p>Thousands of Haitians arrive to the northern border of Mexico, where a humanitarian crisis is declared. However, the asylum requests remain the same as previous years. </p></div> <div class="step" id="fifth-graph"> <h2>2017</h2> <p>The requests are at they historically highest. After the earthquake that struck Mexico on September 19, all the processes open to analyze asylum requests stop. Thousands arrive from Venezuela, running from the economic crisis. The yearly immigrant caravans coming from the Northern Triangle are more crowded than ever. </p></div> </div> </div> <script src="/refugees_mex/01-chart.76d0c658.js"></script> <script src="/refugees_mex/scrollytelling.0a249d40.js"></script> </div></body> </html>

           <p>The increase of gang-related violence and political instability in Central America and Africa, paired with the strict immigration policy in the United States first adopted by Barack Obama and then tightened by President Donald Trump, have turned Mexico into the country of destination for refugees seeking asylum. How have the asylum requests changed during this political administration?</p>

            <p>Six Latin American countries dominate the amount of asylum requests in Mexico. Haiti, the poorest country in the continent, has faced increasing turmoil following the 2010 earthquake that devastated it. Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras form the "Northern Triangle", an area dominated by criminal organizations involved in drug and human trafficking.</p>

              <p>The requests are at they historically highest. After the earthquake that struck Mexico on September 19, all the processes open to analyze asylum requests stop. Thousands arrive from Venezuela, running from the economic crisis. The yearly immigrant caravans coming from the Northern Triangle are more crowded than ever.
